- **Contribute**: Support active campaigns by contributing funds.
- **Refunds**: Claim a refund if a campaign doesn't meet its goal by the deadline.
- **Decentralized**: Built on blockchain for transparency and trustless operations.

## Tech Stack

## How It Works

1. **Campaign Creation**: Users can start a campaign by specifying a funding goal and paying a small fee.
2. **Contributions**: Others can contribute to campaigns they find meaningful.
3. **Goal Check**: If a campaign meets its funding goal, funds are disbursed. Otherwise, contributors can claim refunds.
4. **Blockchain Integration**: All transactions are managed on-chain for transparency and security.
